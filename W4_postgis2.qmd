# Spatial SQL II

This week we're going to be looking at Spatial Joins. We'll be working with DuckDB (though if you want to work with Postgres/PgAdmin, go ahead!). The notebook below contains some exercises on spatial joins using the NYC data we've been working with, as well as an extension that looks at ship-to-ship transfer detection using AIS data.

# Spatial Joins Exercises

Here\'s a reminder of some of the functions we have seen. Hint: they
should be useful for the exercises!

-   `sum(expression)`{.interpreted-text role="command"}: aggregate to
    return a sum for a set of records
-   `count(expression)`{.interpreted-text role="command"}: aggregate to
    return the size of a set of records
-   `ST_Area(geometry)`{.interpreted-text role="command"} returns the
    area of the polygons
-   `ST_AsText(geometry)`{.interpreted-text role="command"} returns WKT
    `text`
-   `ST_Contains(geometry A, geometry B)`{.interpreted-text
    role="command"} returns the true if geometry A contains geometry B
-   `ST_Distance(geometry A, geometry B)`{.interpreted-text
    role="command"} returns the minimum distance between geometry A and
    geometry B
-   `ST_DWithin(geometry A, geometry B, radius)`{.interpreted-text
    role="command"} returns the true if geometry A is radius distance or
    less from geometry B
-   `ST_GeomFromText(text)`{.interpreted-text role="command"} returns
    `geometry`
-   `ST_Intersects(geometry A, geometry B)`{.interpreted-text
    role="command"} returns the true if geometry A intersects geometry B
-   `ST_Length(linestring)`{.interpreted-text role="command"} returns
    the length of the linestring
-   `ST_Touches(geometry A, geometry B)`{.interpreted-text
    role="command"} returns the true if the boundary of geometry A
    touches geometry B
-   `ST_Within(geometry A, geometry B)`{.interpreted-text
    role="command"} returns the true if geometry A is within geometry B

Also remember the tables we have available:

-   `nyc_census_blocks`
    -   name, popn_total, boroname, geom
-   `nyc_streets`
    -   name, type, geom
-   `nyc_subway_stations`
    -   name, routes, geom
-   `nyc_neighborhoods`
    -   name, boroname, geom

# Exercises

-   **What subway station is in \'Little Italy\'? What subway route is it on?**


-   **What are all the neighborhoods served by the 6-train?** (Hint: The `routes` column in the `nyc_subway_stations` table has values like \'B,D,6,V\' and \'C,6\')


-   **After 9/11, the \'Battery Park\' neighborhood was off limits for several days. How many people had to be evacuated?**

-   **What neighborhood has the highest population density (persons/km2)?**


# Ship-to-Ship Transfer Detection

Now for a less structured exercise. We're going to look at ship-to-ship transfers. The idea is that two ships meet up in the middle of the ocean, and one ship transfers cargo to the other. This is a common way to avoid sanctions, and is often used to transfer oil from sanctioned countries to other countries. We're going to look at a few different ways to detect these transfers using AIS data. 

![Ship-to-Ship Transfer](PS_AIS.png)

## Step 1

Create a spatial database using the following AIS data:

https://storage.googleapis.com/qm2/casa0025_ships.csv

Each row in this dataset is an AIS 'ping' indicating the position of a ship at a particular date/time, alongside vessel-level characteristics.

It contains the following columns: 

* `vesselid`: A unique numerical identifier for each ship, like a license plate

* `vessel_name`: The ship's name

* `vsl_descr`: The ship's type

* `dwt`: The ship's Deadweight Tonnage (how many tons it can carry)

* `v_length`: The ship's length in meters

* `draught`: How many meters deep the ship is draughting (how low it sits in the water). Effectively indicates how much cargo the ship is carrying

* `sog`: Speed over Ground (in knots)

* `date`: A timestamp for the AIS signal 

* `lat`: The latitude of the AIS signal (EPSG:4326)

* `lon`: The longitude of the AIS signal (EPSG:4326)

Create a table called 'ais' where each row is a different AIS ping, with no superfluous information. Construct a geometry column. 

Create a second table called 'vinfo' which contains vessel-level information with no superfluous information. 

## Step 2

Use a spatial join to identify ship-to-ship transfers in this dataset.
Two ships are considered to be conducting a ship to ship transfer IF: 

* They are within 500 meters of each other 
* For more than two hours 
* And their speed is lower than 1 knot

Some things to consider: make sure you're not joining ships with themselves. Try working with subsets of the data first while you try different things out.
